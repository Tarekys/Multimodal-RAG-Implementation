# Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct

## Overview
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct is a powerful vision-language model developed by the Qwen team at Alibaba Cloud. With 3 billion parameters, it excels at processing and understanding both text and visual inputs, making it ideal for tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, document analysis, and video understanding.

## Features
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Processes images, text, and videos, supporting tasks like describing images, extracting text from documents, and answering questions about visual content.
- **Multilingual Support**: Handles text in over 29 languages, including Arabic, with strong performance in multilingual contexts.
- **Structured Outputs**: Can generate responses in formats like JSON, suitable for applications like visual agents.
- **Long Video Understanding**: Analyzes videos up to an hour long, answering questions about their content.
- **Optimized for Efficiency**: Runs on GPUs with as little as 6GB VRAM using optimizations like bfloat16 and Accelerate.

## Requirements
### Hardware
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with at least 6GB VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1660 or higher).
- **RAM**: 16GB or more.

### Software
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher.
